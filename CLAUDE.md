# TaxCreditCalculators.com

## What This Is
A content + interactive tools + lead gen site focused on tax credit calculators. Starting with a solar lease vs buy calculator for post-OBBBA (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) decisions. Domain: TaxCreditCalculators.com

## Business Model
NerdWallet-style: free calculators drive SEO traffic, monetize via solar installer/CPA referrals ($50-200/lead). NOT a traditional SaaS. Expand to other tax credit types (EV, energy efficiency, hiring) over time.

## Why This Works
- Section 25D (homeowner purchase credit) expired 12/31/2025
- Section 48E (lease/commercial credit) still active at 30% until 12/31/2027
- Safe harbor construction deadline: July 4, 2026 (creates urgency traffic)
- No clean, neutral lease-vs-buy interactive calculator exists post-OBBBA
- Competitors (EnergySage, SolarReviews, Solar.com) are marketplaces or editorial -- none offer a neutral decision tool

## Competitive Landscape (verified Feb 2026)
- EnergySage: marketplace, wants to sell you a quote
- SolarReviews: editorial + reviews, basic cost estimates
- Solar.com: editorial, no interactive calculator for lease vs buy
- Google Project Sunroof: address-based, no financial comparison tool
- NuWatt Energy: cost-by-state, no lease vs buy
- **Gap: no neutral, interactive, state-specific lease vs buy calculator**

## Moat
1. Domain authority on TaxCreditCalculators.com
2. Interactive complexity AI overviews can't replicate (branching logic, state-specific rules, personalized output)
3. Fastest updates when legislation changes -- tax law churn is the moat
4. Accumulated SEO content over time

## Risks
- Google AI overviews eating simple queries (mitigate: interactive tools that do WORK a paragraph can't)
- Tax credits legislated away (mitigate: platform covering ALL credit types, not just solar)
- Liability from incorrect data (mitigate: verify against DSIRE, disclaimers, "consult a professional")

## Stack (TBD)
Likely: Next.js or static site, Vercel deployment. Keep it simple -- this is a content site with interactive tools, not a complex app.

## Key Tax Law References
- OBBBA (Public Law 119-21): One Big Beautiful Bill Act
- Section 48E: Investment Tax Credit for commercial/lease solar (30%, construction must begin by July 4, 2026)
- Section 25D: Residential Clean Energy Credit (EXPIRED 12/31/2025)
- DSIRE: Database of State Incentives for Renewables & Efficiency (dsireusa.org)

## Tasks (from deliberation)
1. Verify all 50 state tax credit data against DSIRE database
2. Redesign solar calculator with production-quality UI (mobile-first, clean, trustworthy)
3. Deploy to TaxCreditCalculators.com
4. Write 5-10 SEO articles targeting post-OBBBA keywords
5. Set up referral partnerships with solar installers

## Pat's Rules
- No emojis unless asked
- No em dashes
- Ship complete or explicitly flag what's deferred
- Verify data before publishing -- tax misinformation is liability
