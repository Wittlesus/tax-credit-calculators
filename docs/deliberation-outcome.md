# Deliberation Outcome: TaxCreditCalculators.com
**Date:** 2026-02-24
**Agents:** First Principles, Contrarian, Pragmatist, Product Manager, Consumer Specialist, Gen Z Teen

## Verdict
Pursue TaxCreditCalculators.com starting with the solar lease vs buy calculator.

## How We Got Here
1. Started broad: "What underserved SaaS should we build in 2026?"
2. Panel identified distribution as the key constraint -- build for a network you already have
3. Pat's network: developers, indie hackers, AI builders (Twitter, Reddit, HN)
4. Pivoted to dev-focused ideas: API cost monitoring, prompt ops, indie dev tax/bookkeeping
5. Pat revealed he owns TaxCreditCalculators.com with an existing solar calculator prototype
6. Competitive research confirmed: no clean neutral lease-vs-buy calculator exists post-OBBBA
7. Tax law verified correct: Section 25D expired, 48E active for leases, July 4 2026 deadline

## Business Model
- Free interactive calculators (branching logic, state-specific, personalized)
- SEO content targeting post-OBBBA keywords
- Monetize via solar installer/CPA referrals ($50-200/lead)
- Closer to NerdWallet than Stripe -- content + tools + lead gen

## Key Insights
- **Contrarian:** The calculators must do WORK that a paragraph can't. AI overviews eat simple queries. Multi-step branching logic is the defense.
- **Pragmatist:** Tax law churn is actually the moat. You're the one keeping up so users don't have to.
- **Consumer Specialist:** Neutral positioning is the differentiator. EnergySage wants to sell quotes. We're the unbiased advisor.
- **Gen Z Teen:** Parents Google this stuff constantly. Clean design + clear answer in 30 seconds = bookmarked and shared.
- **Product Manager:** Lead gen is faster to revenue than SaaS. Tax pros pay for leads TODAY.
- **First Principles:** The process for keeping data correct matters more than the initial build.

## Risks
1. Google AI overviews eating simple queries -> mitigate with interactive complexity
2. Tax credits legislated away -> mitigate by covering ALL credit types as platform
3. Data accuracy liability -> mitigate with DSIRE verification + disclaimers
4. SEO algorithm changes -> mitigate with direct traffic and referral partnerships

## Next Steps
1. Verify all 50 state credit amounts against DSIRE database
2. Redesign calculator with production-quality UI (mobile-first)
3. Deploy to TaxCreditCalculators.com
4. Write 5-10 SEO articles targeting "solar lease vs buy 2026" keywords
5. Set up referral partnerships with solar installers
