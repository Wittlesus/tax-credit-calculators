## Email Body

Hi [Name],

I run TaxCreditCalculators.com. We built a free solar lease vs buy calculator that shows homeowners why leasing still saves them money after Section 25D expired.

The tool covers all 50 states with real incentive data (SREC, state credits, property tax exemptions) and explains Section 48E in plain language. It walks homeowners from "confused about OBBBA" to "ready for a quote" in 60 seconds.

Here is what I am proposing:

**Option A: We send you leads.**
Homeowners use the calculator, see their savings, and request a quote. We connect them with you. You only pay for qualified leads ($X per lead -- homeowner has selected lease, entered their zip, and requested contact).

**Option B: Embed the calculator on your site.**
White-label the tool on your website. Homeowners on your site use it, see the lease advantage, and convert to your pipeline. Flat monthly fee.

The July 4 safe harbor deadline is creating real urgency right now. Homeowners are searching for answers about what happened to their solar credit. This tool meets them where they are.
