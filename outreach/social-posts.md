### r/solar (primary target)
**Title:** I built a free lease vs buy calculator for 2026 - Section 25D expired but 48E still works for leases

**Body:**
After OBBBA killed Section 25D, I kept seeing confused posts about what solar credits are still available. So I built a free calculator that breaks it down by state.

The short version: if you buy solar in 2026, the 30% federal credit is gone. But if you lease, Section 48E (the Investment Tax Credit) is still active at 30% because the installer claims it and passes savings through lower rates.

The calculator covers all 50 states including state-specific incentives. It flags which states block lease eligibility (MA, AZ, SC) and shows the July 4 safe harbor deadline.

Feedback welcome. Data sourced from DSIRE and state energy offices.

**Title:** PSA: The 30% solar tax credit expired for purchases but still exists for leases - here are the actual numbers by state

**Body:**
A lot of people don't know this: Section 25D (the 30% residential solar credit for homeowner purchases) expired 12/31/2025 under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

But Section 48E -- the Investment Tax Credit for commercially-owned systems -- is still active at 30%. If you lease solar, the installer claims the credit and passes a portion of the savings to you through lower rates.

I built a free calculator that shows the math for all 50 states: https://taxcreditcalculators.com

Key things it shows:
- Federal credit comparison (lease vs buy)
- State incentives (some states have $5-10k+ in additional credits)
- Which states restrict credits for leased systems
- The July 4, 2026 safe harbor deadline for new construction

Not financial advice, but the data is sourced from DSIRE and state energy offices. The 40% pass-through assumption is conservative (industry range is 20-50%).

### r/RealEstate
**Title:** For anyone advising clients on solar in 2026: the federal credit picture changed completely

**Body:**
Quick heads up for real estate professionals. The residential solar landscape shifted significantly after OBBBA:

- Section 25D (homeowner purchase credit): expired 12/31/2025. Buying solar = $0 federal credit.
- Section 48E (commercial/lease credit): still active at 30%. Leasing solar = installer claims credit, passes savings to homeowner.

This matters for home valuations, buyer conversations about solar, and lease transfer during sales.

I put together a free state-by-state calculator: https://taxcreditcalculators.com

It covers all 50 states with incentive data. Might be useful for client conversations.

### Follow-up thread ideas
1. "Most homeowners don't know Section 25D expired. Here's what changed..."
2. "New York lessees can still claim a $5,000 state credit directly. Most states can't."
3. "The July 4, 2026 safe harbor deadline is 4 months away. Here's why that matters."
4. "I verified every state's lease eligibility. 3 states block it entirely: MA, AZ, SC."

## Posting Strategy
1. Post to r/solar first (most relevant audience, will generate discussion)
2. Wait 24 hours, post to r/personalfinance
3. Post to Twitter same day as r/solar
4. r/RealEstate 48 hours later
5. Monitor comments, respond to questions, iterate calculator based on feedback
6. Do NOT post to multiple subreddits on the same day (looks spammy)
